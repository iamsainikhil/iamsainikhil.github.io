  <h4>US State Privacy Laws</h4>
  <p>
    Multiple US states have enacted comprehensive consumer privacy laws since 2020. 
    These laws provide residents with enhanced rights regarding their personal information 
    and impose obligations on businesses that collect personal data.
  </p>

  <h5>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)</h5>
  <p>
    The CCPA, enhanced by the CPRA (effective January 2023), provides California residents 
    with rights to know what personal information is collected, delete personal information, 
    opt-out of the sale or sharing of personal information, and correct inaccurate personal information. 
    The CPRA also introduced the concept of "sensitive personal information" and established 
    the California Privacy Protection Agency.
  </p>

  <h5>Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA)</h5>
  <p>
    Effective January 1, 2023, the VCDPA grants Virginia consumers rights to access, 
    correct, delete, and obtain a copy of their personal data, as well as opt out of 
    targeted advertising and the sale of personal data.
  </p>

  <h5>Colorado Privacy Act (CPA)</h5>
  <p>
    Effective July 1, 2023, the CPA provides Colorado residents with similar rights 
    to access, correct, delete, and port their personal data, plus the right to opt 
    out of targeted advertising and profiling.
  </p>

  <h5>Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA)</h5>
  <p>
    Effective July 1, 2023, the CTDPA grants Connecticut residents rights to access, 
    correct, delete, and port their personal data, as well as opt out of targeted 
    advertising and the sale of personal data.
  </p>

  <h5>Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)</h5>
  <p>
    Effective December 31, 2023, the UCPA provides Utah residents with rights to 
    access and delete personal data and opt out of the sale of personal data and 
    targeted advertising.
  </p>

    <h4>YOUR RIGHTS UNDER PRIVACY LAWS</h4>
  <p>
    Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Right to Know:</strong> You can request information about the personal data I collect, use, and share.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You can request a copy of the personal information I have about you.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You can request that I delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Correct:</strong> You can request that I correct inaccurate personal information.</li>

  <h4>CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT (CalOPPA) COMPLIANCE</h4>
  <p>
    CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites
    and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well
    beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and
    conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally
    Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous
    privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being
    collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. -

      >http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a
    >
  </p>

  <h5>According to CalOPPA, I agree to the following:</h5>
  <p>Users can visit my site anonymously.</p>
  <p>
    Once this privacy policy is created, I will add a link to it on my home page
    or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering my website.
  </p>
  <p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On my Privacy Policy Page</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Can change your personal information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>By emailing me</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICES</h4>
  <p>
    The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law
    in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant
    role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
    Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should
    be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that
    protect personal information.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the
    following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I will notify you via email within 7 business days</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that
    individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data
    collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
  </p>
  <p>
    This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights
    against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or
    government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data
    processors.
  </p>

  <h4>CAN SPAM ACT</h4>
  <p>
    The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,
    establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right
    to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough
    penalties for violations.
  </p>

  <h5>
    I collect your email address when you post comments or email me through
    contact page in order to:
  </h5>
  <ul>
    <li>

    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, I agree to the following:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
    <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>

      remove you from ALL correspondence.
