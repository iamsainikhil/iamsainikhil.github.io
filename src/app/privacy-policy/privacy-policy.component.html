    <p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be
        used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read this privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how I collect, use, protect or otherwise
        handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with https://iamsainikhil.github.io (the “Site”).</p><br/>

    <h4>HOW DO I USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h4>
    <p>I use the Device Information that I collect to help me screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize my Site (for example, by generating analytics about how my customers browse and
        interact with the Site).</p>

    <h4>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
    <p>I use Google Analytics to help me understand how my users use the Site--you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here: <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>.
        You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>

    <h4>HOW DO I PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?</h4>
    <p>My website is scanned on a regular basis for security issues and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to my site as safe as possible.</p>
    <p>Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.</p>
    <p>In addition, all sensitive information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. I implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personalinformation.</p>


    <h4>DO NOT TRACK</h4>
    <p>Please note that I do not alter my Site’s data collection and use practices when I see a Do Not Track signal from your browser.</p>

    <h4>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>
    <p>
        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world)
        that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it
        is being shared. - See more at: <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a>
    </p>

    <h5>According to CalOPPA, I agree to the following:</h5>
    <p>Users can visit my site anonymously.</p>
    <p>Once this privacy policy is created, I will add a link to it on my home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering my website.</p>
    <p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>On my Privacy Policy Page</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Can change your personal information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>By emailing me</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICES</h4>
    <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information
        Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

    <h5>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</h5>
    <p>I will notify you via email within 7 business days</p>
    <p>I also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.</p>
    <p>This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

    <h4>CAN SPAM ACT</h4>
    <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

    <h5>I collect your email address when you post comments or email me through contact page in order to:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, I agree to the following:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
        <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
        <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
        <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used</li>
        <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
        <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email me at</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Follow the instructions at the bottom of each email and I will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>DATA RETENTION</h4>
    <p>The data I collection through google analytics will be stored for a maximum of 24 months and any comments data will be stored forever. However, your data is strictly secured and can only be accessed by me.</p>

    <h4>CHANGES</h4>
    <p>I may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to my practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.</p>
